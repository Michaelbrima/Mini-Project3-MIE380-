# Mini-Project3-MIE380-
This project consists of R code used to calculate the statistical probabilities of a companyâ€™s 5-year stock price performance data (from a Microsoft Excel .csv file). (Please note, I had worked on this project with a colleague in college and I had done so under my former name, Mustapha Brima.)
In order to run, please run the 'Carey_Brima_MP3.R' file and import the 'SCD5Y.csv' file into the program used.
